My first coding project ever. Having no idea what I was doing, I had to figure a lot of it out on my own. The four programs there allow a player in SL to rez and control a disc, similar to the Frisbee like discs in Tron.
The system resources we worked with were very limited. It ran in real time in an FPS-style environment. All the code had to be as efficient as possible, or else lag would show up. The scripting environment was Second Life. The scripting language itself was very limited, and I had to use a lot of creativity to get around the communication limitations they put on scripts.
One of my primary objectives was to use good structure among my user defined functions (UDFs). I tried to make each function modular, so I could easily repurpose it as the program grew.
There were many challenges, hours poured into learning the math and the concepts to write this. But when finished, it was a pretty impressive release. This was also my first team project I managed, and all the parts came together in the end.
