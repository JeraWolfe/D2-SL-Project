Question 4:

Hands on experience, anecdotal advice from someone who is skilled. It basically boils down to a communication issue. In College during my personal communication class we were split up into groups of five. Two of us had to build a piece of art out of some linken logs. Then, using only written instructions from the couple that built it, two more of us had to reocnstruct the object. The last member was our message carrier.
The first attempt, we were only allowed to read the instructions, to give no feedback.
The results were amusing.
Second we could send back questions on the same piece of paper, and this showed real progress, but there was still some loss of meaning, as the two completed art forms never quite matched.
Finally, we were able to just talk to each other, and those who built it could talk and tell us how to fix the mistakes we were starting to make from the original instructions.
The results of both couples matched.
This is, I think, the most powerful argument for why mentoring is worth more than a book. Why being taught by someone who has done it is superior to trying to learn from someone else's one way instruction.
