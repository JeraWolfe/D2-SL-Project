Question 3:

This is a difficult question. Learning is an important thing to me. And I've always asked myself where and how do I learn better, how can I maximize my effectiveness in understanding this information so I can get right to using it. I did very well and enjoyed Basic Training in the military. It was almost a monastic experience, just me and my tasks. I was completely free to focus on learning, with no distractions. That pure kind of intellectual pursuit is very enjoyable for me.
But I cannot over-stress the value I find in having a mentor, in a live teacher. Having someone who understands and works successfully with what you are learning gives a student access to real time refinement of their learning process or method. Where a student has to work their mind around new information, a mentor can help shape a lesson to fit a student's method of learning. At the very least, they can show them, walk them through the steps, and give examples of how its done.
And finally, hands on training. Working with and experimenting with the subject that your learning provides me with instant feedback, and it makes the information real, because I'm using it, in a way reading it will seldom ever do. While book learning will give invaluable understanding, it is experimentation and real experience that gives a student a 'feel' for what they're working with.

This may be partially Question 4 too.
