Question 8:

I would say my strongest skill is brainstorming. Life has been a series of interesting obstacles, and each one has required a lot of creative problem solving.
So its a good thing I enjoy it, I have lots of opportunities to test out my favorite skill set these days.
I enjoy breaking a problem down, trying to reduce it to workable bits. I enjoy coming up with new ideas and new approaches to a problem. I don't accept a limitation, I always assume there must be a work around or work through, if you are clever and intelligent enough to see it.
I am willing to come up with ideas and not worry about them being discarded. I have no shame in suggesting something and having it shot down, or even being repurposed.
Early on in school, I was in the gifted and talented program, two days a week I'd get to go to another school and study with kids from other schools that were like me, apparently gifted and talented. They focused on brainstorming and creative problem solving.
I was encouraged to come up with ideas, even unlikely ones, and not fear reprisal, so it's always been in me since to just raise my hand or give a suggestion.
I have also learned that not all points in a job routine require brainstorming, and at some points in a taks, it's not welcome.
But during the early part of a project, and through it, when a problem comes up, a new problem, I very much love finding ways to work around it. I have a love of elegance, finding the simplest answer to as many problems as possible.
Real life has taught me you don't always have time to find that answer, but even after a problem's been patched, I find I'll still be chewing on it until I do get to an answer I'm satisfied with. And there's always time to go back later and refine.
Brainstorming is something I'm good at.
